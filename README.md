# barrel

A wacky esoteric programming language. I was inspired to write an esolang after randomly writing a [Small](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Small) interpreter and came up with this.

The spec can be found in [spec.md](spec.md).

The barrel interpreter is written mostly using Qt.

Why the name? It was a random word that popped into my head when I originally created barrel, but the motto of barrel is: "Barreling along through obscure code."
