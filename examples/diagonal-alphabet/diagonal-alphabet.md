# diagonal-alphabet
An implementation of [this code golf challenge](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/125117/diagonal-alphabet) that prints the alphabet in all lowercase, plus adds the allowed trailing newline. An all-uppercase version can be generated by substituting `65` for `97` in this snippet.

Explanation:

```
^97                    // push 97 (the ASCII value of 'a') to the accumulator
   #26                 // Execute the following statement 26 times
      (              ) // jam lots of stuff into the loop statement (create a single-statement chunk of code)
       [               // push the accumulator to the stack
        #97-           // decrease the accumulator by the ASCII value of 'a'
            #a' '      // Range-loop to print a space (so if the previous statement yielded 2, print '  ')
                 ]     // pop the accumulator to preserve the character we're on
                  pÂ¶   // print the accumulator as an ASCII character, then print a newline
                    +  // increment the accumulator to the next letter
```
