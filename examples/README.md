# Barrel examples
This directory contains examples of barrel code, along with explanations in correspondingly-named files. For example, the Fibonacci numbers example in `fibonacci.barrel` has an explanation located in `fibonacci-explanation.txt`. All `.barrel` files can be run with the barrel interpreter by running `barrel -f file.barrel` where `file.barrel` is the file you want to run.
