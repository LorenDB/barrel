'Hello world!

This is a barrel program to demonstrate stuff.
Strings can break across newlines!'^48'
The accumulator now stands at 'n'.
The char value of the accumulator is "'p'".'
-'
The character coming before numbers (in ASCII) is "'p'".'

This stri'n'g w'a's im'p'licitly 'p'ri'n'ted' up until the
previous "printed". However, some special characters were
quoted. Without the quotes, it would look like this:

'This string was implicitly printed.

['Random number: '[|n?a$$'
Wow, the random number was zero! Very unlikely for that to happen.'$'

Restoring the accumulator from the stack with ]: ']n or "p"

'Doubling some numbers: '^1#a+n [#256-?a$]<15$$
